# pacmanseniorproject

Hi!

My name's Brianna.
This is a project I created and worked on from December 2020 - June 2021 in my senior year of high school.

It is a recreation of Pacman.

I used PyCharm Community edition 2020.3.2 with Pygame.

Controls:
Navigate the main screen by using the up/down arrow keys and enter to choose that selection.
Hit exit from the main screen to exit.
While playing the game, escape brings you to the main menu
Escape also brings you out of every screen (except the Win Screen, that is s to go back to the main menu)
Use the up/down/left/right arrow keys to move around (hold them down to continuously move).
